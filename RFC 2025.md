1. PREAMBLE: THE NECESSITY OF COGNITIVE TOOLING Humanity has evolved by externalizing biological functions into tools: we externalized digestion via fire, locomotion via the wheel, and calculation via the silicon chip. This protocol asserts that navigating the current information ecosystem requires a similar externalization of Pattern Recognition.

The complexity of modern algorithmic polarization exceeds the processing bandwidth of the unassisted human mind. Therefore, the use of High-Dimensional Pattern Matching (Artificial Intelligence) in this protocol is not an abdication of human reason, but a necessary "Cognitive Transcoder" required to demodulate the signal from the noise. We do not apologize for using the telescope to see the stars; we shall not apologize for using LLMs to advocate for a better world to live in.

2. ABSTRACT Current media distribution protocols (HLS, DASH, RSS) prioritize chronological delivery and engagement metrics (clicks/views), resulting in a "Race to the Bottom" of amygdala-triggering content. This document proposes a new metadata layer—SICTP—that scores content based on Semantic Integrity (factual grounding) and Constructive Tension (cross-demographic consensus).

3. THE CORE METRICS (The "Packet Headers") Just as a data packet has a header defining its destination, every media object shall carry a SICTP_Header containing three calculated float values (0.0 - 1.0):

    3.1. The Consensus Weight (Cw)

        Definition: A measure of the diversity of the audience validating this content.

        Calculation: Cw approaches 1.0 only when validated by users with opposing Interaction_History_Vectors (e.g., User A and User B usually disagree, but both validated this).

        Engineering Utility: Used to prioritize "High Signal" content over "Echo Chamber" noise.

    3.2. The Semantic Distance (Sd)

        Definition: The complexity gap between the user's current worldview and the content presented.

        Calculation: High Sd indicates a challenging, novel perspective. Low Sd indicates "Vanilla Paste" or confirmation bias.

        Engineering Utility: Used to filter out low-effort engagement bait.

    3.3. The Dissent Validity Score (Dv)

        Definition: A check against "Mob Rule." If Cw is > 0.9 (Mob Mentality), the system scans for high-quality dissent.

        Calculation: Derived from the logical structure and citation density of counter-arguments.

4. IMPLEMENTATION (The "Socrates Filter") Client-side aggregators (browsers, feed readers) implementing SICTP shall not censor content. Instead, they shall apply a Dynamic Render based on the score:

    Cw < 0.2 (Rage Bait): Content Blurred. User must explicitly opt-in to view.

    Cw > 0.8 AND Dv < 0.1 (Mob Rule): Flagged. Content is displayed with an auto-generated "Challenge Context" sidebar.

    Cw > 0.5 AND Sd > 0.5 (Constructive Tension): Gold Standard. Content is visually highlighted and algorithmically boosted.


5. CONCLUSION This protocol aims to refactor the "Source Code" of the attention economy by moving the optimization function from Engagement to Alignment.
